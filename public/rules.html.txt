</ul><h1 id="1-league-format">1 League Format</h1><h2 id="11-regular-season-format">1.1 Regular Season Format</h2><p>The competition will be split into 3 brackets - Premier, Intermediate and Open. Premier and Intermediate brackets sizes will be dependent on signups, while Open shall be unrestricted.</p><p>The regular season will be played over 7 weeks, with finals rounds lasting approximately 2 weeks. It is a team’s responsibility to commit to the full length of the season when they submit an application.</p><p>Two maps will be played for each regular season match. Matches are expected to last just over an hour.</p><h3 id="premier">Premier</h3><p>The regular season will be run on a Round Robin system, where each team plays each other once.</p><h3 id="intermediate-and-open">Intermediate and Open</h3><p>The regular season will be run on a Swiss system, where each round is seeded based on the previous records of teams.</p><p>See <a href="#14-swiss-system">Rule 1.4</a> for further details on the Swiss system.</p><h2 id="12-playoffs-format">1.2 Playoffs Format</h2><p>At the conclusion of the regular season, the top four placing teams of each bracket advance to playoffs.</p><p>Playoffs matches will each be a best of 3 with the exception of the Premier Grand Final.</p><h3 id="premier1">Premier</h3><p>A playoffs bracket will be played using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system" target="_blank">page playoff system</a>.</p><p>In the Upper Page Playoff, the first and second placed teams will play against each other. The winner advances directly to the Grand Final.</p><p>In the Lower Page Playoff, the third and fourth placed teams will play against each other. The loser is eliminated.</p><p>The loser of the Upper Page Playoff will compete with the winner of the Lower Page Playoff in the Semi-Final. The loser of the Semi-Final will receive Third Place and the winner will advance to the Grand Final. There is no Bronze Match for Premier.</p><p>Unlike other playoff matches, the Grand Final of Premier will be played as a best of 5.</p><h3 id="intermediate-and-open1">Intermediate and Open</h3><p>Intermediate and Open playoffs will be played as a single elimination bracket with a Bronze Match.</p><p>Semi-Final matches will be based on regular season placements:</p><ul>
<li>First vs Fourth place</li>
<li>Second vs Third place</li>
</ul><p>The winners from each Semi-Final advance directly to the Grand Final while the losers play in the Bronze Match.</p><h2 id="13-fixtures">1.3 Fixtures</h2><p>Regular season match fixtures will be posted week to week after each round has been finalised. Fixtures are set at weekly intervals to be played between Sunday and Thursday.</p><p>Match pages will be posted on the Friday prior to that round’s fixtures.</p><h2 id="14-swiss-system">1.4 Swiss System</h2><p>The Swiss system allows a large number of competitors to compete against each other in a relatively small number of rounds. The first round will be scheduled randomly, and each subsequent round will be generated based on the previous results of teams. Teams with the same or similar records will be paired against each other, and two teams will never be paired against each other twice.</p><h2 id="15-match-scoring">1.5 Match Scoring</h2><p>Each match consists of two maps; the winner of each individual map will be awarded 2 league points, while the loser is awarded zero. In the event of a map draw, see <a href="#17-draws">Rule 1.7</a>.</p><p>Rankings will first be determined by these match points. If point draws exist, the following methods will be used to break them:</p><p><strong>Premier</strong></p><ol>
<li>Match wins vs. Tied participants.</li>
<li>Total match wins.</li>
<li>Win difference (Total points scored vs. total points lost).</li>
</ol><p><strong>Intermediate and Open</strong></p><ol>
<li>Match wins vs. Tied participants.</li>
<li>Median-Buchholz score (total).</li>
<li>Win difference (Total points earned minus total points lost).</li>
</ol><h2 id="16-forfeits">1.6 Forfeits</h2><p>A maximum of one forfeit per team is permitted in ozfortress competitions, on the second forfeit a team is considered inactive and removed from the league. Exclusion penalties will then apply for future ozfortress participation. See <a href="#25-disbanded-or-removed-teams">Rule 2.5</a> for more information on disbanded and removed teams.</p><p>It is the team captain’s responsibility to contact your bracket’s Administrator as soon as possible if there is a change in circumstances that will affect your team’s ability to field a team each round, even if it is a temporary problem.</p><p><strong>ANY forfeit in finals rounds will result in a removal from the league and additional sanctions on the offending team.</strong></p><h3 id="forfeit-types">Forfeit Types</h3><h4 id="forfeit-win">Forfeit Win</h4><p>A forfeit win will be awarded where the offending team has not made an effort to organise the match. Forfeit wins will also be considered as a punitive measure where serious rule breaches have been committed during a match. A forfeit win will be recorded as match win worth 4 league points. See <a href="#46-submitting-forfeit-wins">Rule 4.6</a> on how to submit a forfeit win.</p><h4 id="mutual-forfeit">Mutual Forfeit</h4><p>Mutual forfeits will be applied where neither team have made an effort to organise the match within a reasonable timeframe. A mutual forfeit will be recorded as a match loss for both teams, worth 0 league points.</p><h4 id="technical-forfeit">Technical Forfeit</h4><p>A technical forfeit will be awarded in cases where situations outside the teams’ control occur, preventing both teams from playing the match, including but not limited to, Steam outages or major weather events. A technical forfeit will be recorded as a match draw, worth 2 league points for each team.</p><h2 id="17-draws">1.7 Draws</h2><p>Draws on individual maps are not possible in the ozfortress ruleset, as the map will be determined by a Golden Cap, however matches can result in a draw when each team wins one map.</p><h2 id="18-administrators">1.8 Administrators</h2><p>Administrators are responsible for the efficient running of ozfortress competitions. Each bracket will be assigned administrators who will be the first point of contact for support and any disputes. However, all league administrators are able to assist or deliver rulings on disputes if your bracket administrator is not available.</p><p>The League Coordinator is ultimately responsible for the general running of the league.</p><h2 id="19-foreign-teams-and-players">1.9 Foreign Teams and Players</h2><p>ozfortress primarily caters players from Australia and New Zealand, however players from other areas such as Asia are welcome to compete. Foreign teams must still play on ozfortress servers, unless it is determined that using an alternative server is beneficial for both the native and foreign teams. For example, in a match between teams from Singapore and Western Australia may choose to use an approved server located in Perth.</p><h2 id="110-sportsmanship">1.10 Sportsmanship</h2><p>Teams participating are required to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner in all communications.</p><p>Global chat is not fully restricted and may be used for light, friendly and tasteful banter. However, at the request of either team captain or an ozfortress administrator, chat may be restricted to only essential match communication. This request must be clearly stated in global chat or the match thread.</p><p>Discrimination on the basis of, but not limited to, race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, or age will be regarded as an extreme breach of sportsmanship.</p><p>Breach of the sportsmanship clause may result in exclusion penalties to be determined by the ozfortress administration.</p><h1 id="2-teams">2 Teams</h1><h2 id="21-application">2.1 Application</h2><p>Teams apply preseason to enter the league and nominate their desired bracket. A minimum of six eligible players are required for the application to be processed, however we recommend that teams have a minimum of two backups on their roster. It is expected that your team is available to play at least three days out of the five eligible days.</p><p>Although there is no maximum number of players that teams may have on signup, transfers will not be allowed if the roster size is ten or greater. See <a href="#26-transfers">Rule 2.6</a> for further information regarding transfers and roster limits.</p><h2 id="22-player-eligibility">2.2 Player Eligibility</h2><p><strong>To be eligible to be accepted onto a team’s roster, a player must:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Have an ozfortress Citadel account.</li>
<li>Not be under any current competition exclusion penalties.</li>
</ul><h2 id="23-captains">2.3 Captains</h2><p>A team must nominate a player to act as a captain to represent the team in organizing matches and liaising with ozfortress administrators. This player has the ultimate responsibility for their team. Captains may be excluded from acting as team captain for future competitions if ozfortress administrators consider them to be unfit to lead.</p><h2 id="24-mutiny-rule">2.4 Mutiny Rule</h2><p>A simple majority of registered team members may elect to nominate a new captain, or remove the captain entirely, at any point of the season with the approval of the league coordinator. This may be used when a captain is the sole reason for an imminent disband of a team. In this situation, the team at large will remain without penalty.</p><h2 id="25-disbanded-or-removed-teams">2.5 Disbanded or Removed Teams</h2><p>The captain of a disbanded or removed team is not permitted to lead another team in ozfortress tournaments. Administrators will subject future applications from a disbanded or removed team to a closer review.</p><p>To avoid penalty, captains and/or team members should approach League Administrators at the first sign of trouble to determine a solution.</p><h2 id="26-transfers">2.6 Transfers</h2><p>Teams may transfer in players on a weekly basis. The transfer application must be submitted by the match deadline of a round to be eligible for play in the following round. A thread will be posted at the start of the season detailing this process.</p><p>Teams will only be able to increase the size of their roster throughout the season to a maximum of ten players. Teams with ten players or more may not increase their roster size through transfers unless enough players have been transferred out of their team to put their roster size under the limit. However, teams may submit a roster larger than ten in their application as explained in <a href="#21-application">Rule 2.1</a>.</p><p>Administrators reserve the right to deny transfer applications.</p><h2 id="27-infractions-warnings-and-exclusions">2.7 Infractions, Warnings, and Exclusions</h2><p>In each competition, administrators will keep track of rule breaches. Warnings and Infractions will be posted on the match and roster pages.</p><p>There is no specific number of infractions or warnings to determine if a team is to be excluded from a competition; the judgement by the discretion of the administrators.</p><p>Exclusions will be applied for repeated major rule breaches by a player or team. An exclusion will result in the immediate ejection of the player or team from the league, with potential prohibitions from playing in future competitions. In serious cases, exclusions may apply for first offenses.</p><h1 id="3-match-organisation">3 Match Organisation</h1><h2 id="31-negotiating-match-times">3.1 Negotiating Match Times</h2><p>Each team must select a minimum of three days in which they are able to play. Captains may change your team’s availability from a week to week basis from Thursday 4PM to Saturday 8PM. Once the match for the round has been posted, teams can begin negotiating to arrange a time and date for their match. If a match time has not been negotiated between the teams, the earliest matching day from both team’s selections will be appointed as the default date. However, this default date can be changed under agreement of both teams.</p><p>It is expected that team captains or a nominated team member make a reasonable effort to organise their match before the organisation deadline. Team members who facetiously propose match times will be punished.</p><p>Communications in match threads are considered the authoritative log for all correspondence about match organisation. Teams may decide to (and are encouraged to) negotiate the match over Steam chat or other means, however we recommend posting chat logs in the thread to prove that such correspondence has taken place in case of a dispute.</p><p>The negotiated time must always be posted in the thread.</p><p>If it is proving difficult to get in contact with the other team, or they are not making a reasonable effort to organise the match, please bring it to the attention of your bracket’s League Administrator immediately.</p><h2 id="32-match-deadlines">3.2 Match Deadlines</h2><p><strong>Match time set:</strong> 7:00pm Sunday</p><p><strong>Results submission:</strong> 11:59pm Thursday</p><h2 id="33-organisational-responsibilities">3.3 Organisational Responsibilities</h2><p>The responsibility for these tasks fall upon the team captain of each team. If he is unable to complete these tasks or ensure these tasks are completed, he must nominate another team member to ensure their completion.</p><p><strong>Both teams must:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Make appropriate effort to organise the match.</li>
<li>Ensure attendance to the match.</li>
<li>Inform the other team of any mercenaries and post their usage in the match thread.</li>
<li>Inform administrators of any potential issues with the match, or of any disputes.</li>
<li>Submit or verify the final score within an hour of the match ending.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The home team must:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Organise the server.</li>
<li>Appropriately administrate the server during the match.</li>
</ul><h3 id="score-submission">Score Submission</h3><p><strong>Teams must clearly state both the winner and match score of each map</strong></p><p>Logs and booking name must also be linked. If a non-ozfortress server was used, a download link to the demos must be provided.</p><p>Example:<br>
cp_granary_pro: 4-1 Jasmine Tea <a href="http://logs.tf/xxxxxx" target="_blank">logs.tf/xxxxxx</a><br>
cp_badlands: 4-2 no safeword <a href="http://logs.tf/xxxxxx" target="_blank">logs.tf/xxxxxx</a><br>
Booked under name: Paulsen</p><h2 id="34-mercenaries">3.4 Mercenaries</h2><p>A mercenary is an unrostered player that is used in lieu of an unavailable team member. To be valid, mercenaries must have an ozfortress Citadel account and not be under any exclusion penalties.</p><p>Only <strong>one</strong> mercenary per team is allowed in each match. Each team is allowed to use mercenaries <strong>three times per season</strong>.</p><p>Mercenaries may only be used at the <strong>discretion of the opposing team captain</strong>. There is no restriction on mercenary use if allowed by the opposing team captain. Do be aware that it is unlikely that opposing team captains will allow players of significantly larger skill to participate in the match and therefore reasonable requests are preferred.</p><p>Team captains do have the right to deny any mercenary, even if they are from a lower bracket. However, please do try to accommodate reasonable mercenary use, as you may find yourself in the same position. We recommend contacting an administrator if you are unsure of the skill level of the potential mercenary.</p><p>ozfortress administrators will act as arbitrators in such a case of unreasonable mercenary denial, and may decide to overrule a team captain’s decision and allow a mercenary of a reasonable skill level.</p><p>Mercenaries are not allowed in playoff matches. Teams playing in playoffs must use players from the league roster only.</p><p>Mercenary use must be clearly stated in the match thread where they are used. The information provided must include their SteamID and link to their ozfortress Citadel profile.</p><h2 id="35-map-selection">3.5 Map Selection</h2><p>Regular season matches will use two pre-defined maps from the map pool.</p><p>Maps for playoff matches are selected by the captains of each team in the game server chat prior to the game starting.</p><p>The selection process:</p><ol>
<li>The higher seeded or home team will either choose to ban first or defer.</li>
<li>The first team (determined by the result of step one) will ban a map.</li>
<li>The second team will ban a map.</li>
<li>The first team will select the first map from the remaining pool.</li>
<li>The second team will select the second map from the remaining pool.</li>
<li>The first team will select the tiebreaker map from the remaining maps.</li>
</ol><p>For the Premier Grand Final, the selection process varies as follows:</p><ol start="6">
<li>The first team will select the third map from the remaining pool.</li>
<li>The second team will select the fourth map from the remaining pool.</li>
<li>The remaining map will be the tiebreaker map.</li>
</ol><p>During this process, general chat must only be used by team captains. All mentions of valid maps during each teams turn will be considered a pick or a ban, so please do not propose joke picks. Non captains using chat may cause a team to lose one of their selections.</p><h2 id="36-match-disputes">3.6 Match Disputes</h2><p>To lodge a dispute or report misconduct, please contact an ozfortress administrator as soon as possible. Please do not bring the debate into public as it’s being resolved.</p><h2 id="37-fakenicking">3.7 Fakenicking</h2><p>Fakenicking is not allowed in any ozfortress matches. Players must use a name similar to their submitted roster name, and hence their forum name, as to be generally recognizable to someone comparing team rosters with those on the server. Clan and sponsorship tags are allowed but must be reasonable. Players are encouraged to carefully choose their submitted roster name.</p><p>Fakenicking rules will be more closely enforced in casted matches.</p><h1 id="4-match-format">4. Match Format</h1><h2 id="41-team-eligibility-requirements">4.1 Team Eligibility Requirements</h2><p>Teams must have a minimum of five rostered (does not include any mercenaries) players ready to start or continue a match.</p><h2 id="42-demo-recording">4.2 Demo Recording</h2><p>POV demos must be recorded for all ozfortress matches, and must be provided on the request of an ozfortress administrator. We recommend using the demo recording system included in TF2, which can be activated under the advanced options menu in the game settings.</p><p>Demos are required to be stored for the current and past season.</p><p><strong>If you are unable to provide POV demos for a match you will face a 2 round exclusion. It is the player’s responsibility to ensure that demos are being recorded.</strong></p><h2 id="43-spectators">4.3 Spectators</h2><p>ozfortress Administrators are the only approved spectators. If you desire for others to spectate your game, please contact an ozfortress administrator to set you up with a Source TV link.</p><h2 id="44-pausing">4.4 Pausing</h2><p>Pausing during a match are allowed where players clearly exhibit technological performance issues. In addition, the match may only be unpaused by the team who initiated the pause. Both teams must give the all-clear to unpause, which is followed by an in-built five second countdown.</p><p>Each team is permitted two pauses per match with a combined total time limit of ten minutes. However, if captains are in agreement, the pause limit can be extended.</p><h2 id="45-casted-games">4.5 Casted Games</h2><p>Official matches may be casted from a private STV, with the approval of the ozfortress. This is subject to streamer and caster availability. If your game is to be casted, your team must provide to the caster(s), streamer or organisation representative:</p><ul>
<li>The server connect string.</li>
<li>An updated list of players and/or any mercenaries participating in the match. This must be provided at least an hour before the set match time.</li>
</ul><p>Casting organization representatives may contact the ozfortress Media Coordinator or the ozfortress League Director for approval to cover ozfortress matches officially, and receive promotion. Approval will only be granted once it is determined by ozfortress that the coverage meets approved standards.</p><h2 id="46-submitting-forfeit-wins">4.6 Submitting Forfeit Wins</h2><p>Teams are expected to be readied up in the server by 15 minutes past the set match time. If your team is readied up in the server at such time, and the other team is not fully present or is refusing to ready up, please contact an ozfortress administrator to claim a forfeit win.</p><p>If the home team is not communicating, the away team is expected to book an ozfortress server and attempt to provide server details. If at 15 minutes past the home team has not joined the server or provided details to their own booked server, a forfeit win will be distributed.</p><h2 id="47-ozfortress-administrators-as-referees">4.7 ozfortress Administrators as Referees</h2><p>ozfortress may sometimes require certain matches to be refereed by an ozfortress administrator. In such case, a post will be made in the match thread denoting this, and teams will be provided with a connect string before the match. If this happens, it is no longer the home team’s responsibility to administer the server or report the scores at the end of the round.</p><p>All Grand Final matches will be refereed. Other important matches will be refereed as required.</p><h1 id="5-servers">5. Servers</h1><h2 id="51-server-configuration">5.1 Server Configuration</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/ozfortress/server-configs" target="_blank">Instructions on how to download &amp; install ozfortress seasonal league configs can be found here.</a></p><h2 id="52-preferred-and-acceptable-servers">5.2 Preferred and Acceptable Servers</h2><p>ozfortress bookable servers are considered the standard for matches. However, if both teams agree, an alternative server may be used. See <a href="#53-third-party-servers">Rule 5.3</a> for further details on Third party servers.</p><p>If teams cannot agree on a server, an official ozfortress server must be used.</p><p>Administrators reserve the right to choose which server a match may be played on.</p><h2 id="53-third-party-servers">5.3 Third Party Servers</h2><p>For those who wish to run their own, servers must be running the official ozfortress configuration to be considered match-ready. They must also comply with the following requirements:</p><ul>

<li>Sourcemod plugins are not required but may be loaded as long as they are not considered gameplay altering modifications.</li>
<li>Must have configured SourceTV to allow recording of STV demos and relay attachment.</li>
</ul><p>If desired, an ozfortress administrator will review your server configs to determine if you have configured it to match-ready standard.</p><p>rcon for third party servers must be provided to ozfortress administrators on request.</p><p>ozfortress administrators reserve the right to force a match to be played on an ozfortress server.</p><h2 id="54-class-restrictions">5.4 Class Restrictions</h2><p>The ozfortress seasonal league runs on the following class restrictions:</p><ul>
